# CH33SE: A Mousey Dungeon-Crawler

Per instruction of the CalArts Game Design course: a single-player, single-sheet paper game that requires no more additional utilities than two six-sided dice and a pencil.

The game must also involve some level of difficulty induced by skill or chance, and some amount of story for player motivation.

Minor spelling errors.

Multiplayer is possible if multiple players take the role of mice, competing to see who can gather the most cheese. Another player can even take on the role of the chef, tossing dice onto the board to hinder or knock out the mice.
