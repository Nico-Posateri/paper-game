# CH33SE: A Mousey Dungeon-Crawler

Per instruction of the CalArts Game Design course, a single-player, single-sheet paper game that requires no more additional utilities than two six-sided dice and a pencil.

The game must also involve some level of difficulty induced by skill or chance, and some amount of story for player motivation.
